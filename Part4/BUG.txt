Oops, was that card yours?

	Issue: 
		- Vulnerability allows any user to use any giftcard put request. 
		- So a hacker can access/use a gift card belonging to someone else by just manipulating the REST API put request.
	
	Reason:
		
		- Lack of aunthencation checking in the use gift card functionality.
		- Only Authorization token key and gift card number is validated.

	Fix:
	
		- We need put a check to validate whether the gift card provided is associated with the loggedin user. If true then the response must be success or a failure.
		- One way to acheive this is to validate whether the Authorization token matches the card owner's token.
		- Another way is to add verification at server side by validating userid of giftcard provided and loggedin users id. If both doesn't match, then we can send a failed response.
